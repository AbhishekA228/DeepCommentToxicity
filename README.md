# DeepCommentToxicity
Overview
The Deep Comment Toxicity Model is designed to effectively identify and mitigate toxic comments, promoting healthier online interactions and fostering positive discourse within digital communities. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this model aims to create safer and more welcoming online environments.

Features
Accurate Toxicity Detection: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to accurately detect various forms of toxic language, including hate speech, harassment, and abusive language.
Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of data, making it suitable for integration with popular social media platforms, forums, and other online communities.
Customizable: Offers the flexibility to adjust sensitivity and specific definitions of toxicity according to the needs of different platforms and communities.
Real-Time Analysis: Capable of processing comments in real-time, enabling immediate action to be taken against toxic behavior.
Installation
To install and set up the Deep Comment Toxicity Model, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AbhishekA228/DeepCommentToxicity
cd DeepCommentToxicity
Install Dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download Pre-trained Model:
Download the pre-trained model weights from this link and place them in the models/ directory.

Usage
Training the Model
If you wish to train the model from scratch or fine-tune it on a specific dataset, follow these steps:

Prepare Your Dataset:
Ensure your dataset is in the appropriate format (e.g., CSV) with columns for comments and their corresponding toxicity labels.

Train the Model:

sh
Copy code
python train.py --data_path path/to/your/dataset.csv
Running Inference
To use the model for predicting the toxicity of new comments, you can run the inference script:

sh
Copy code
python inference.py --input "This is an example comment"
This will output the toxicity score and classification for the provided comment.

Configuration
The model can be configured using a YAML configuration file (config.yaml). Key parameters include:

Model Parameters: Adjust the architecture, layers, and other neural network parameters.
Training Parameters: Set the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
Thresholds: Define the sensitivity of the toxicity detection.
